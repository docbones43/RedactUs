# RedactUs

**The tool you MUST run before sending files to ChatGPT.**

**Strip identity. Keep data such as health queries or financial statements 100% client-side.**

RedactUs is a privacy redaction engine that removes personal identifiers from text before it reaches any AI service. It runs entirely in the browser — zero server calls, zero dependencies, works offline.

Born from [AI Doctor Ben](https://the.aidoctorben.com), a health-tech application with embedded redaction services where members need to share medical data with multiple AI without exposing their identity.

## Products

### [Standalone Tool](/standalone/) — FREE

A single HTML file. Download it, open it in your browser, paste your text, click Redact. That's it.

**No installation. No account. No internet required. Works forever.**

- 20+ pattern types across UK, US, and EU regions
- Names, addresses, phone numbers, NHS numbers, SSNs, MRNs, insurance IDs, and more
- Markdown stripping pre-processor (handles text pasted from AI tools)
- Unicode dash support (catches formatted PDFs and documents)

**Get started:** Download [`standalone/index.html`](/standalone/index.html) and open in any browser.

**Integrate into your app:** Import [`standalone/redactus-engine.js`](/standalone/redactus-engine.js) as a JS module.

```javascript
import { redactText } from './redactus-engine.js';

const result = redactText("Patient: John Smith, NHS 943 476 5919", { region: 'UK' });
console.log(result.redactedText);
// → "Patient: [NAME-REDACTED], NHS [NHS-REDACTED]"
```

## How It Works

```
Your text  →  RedactUs (in your browser)  →  Clean text  →  AI service
                    ↓
         Identity stripped here.
         Never leaves your device.
```

| What's stripped (your identity) | What passes through (your health data) |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Name, DOB, address, postcode/ZIP | Cholesterol, blood glucose, HbA1c |
| NHS number, SSN, MRN | Vitamin levels, hormones, medications |
| Phone, email | Symptoms, conditions, test results |
| Clinician and hospital names | Lab reference ranges and units |
| Insurance IDs, claim codes | Your question to the AI |
